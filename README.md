# Procedural Terrain Generator in Unity

This Unity project demonstrates a simple procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise.  
Weâ€™ve also added a basic texture painting system to modify terrain visuals in real-time.

## Features
- Procedural heightmap generation using Perlin noise
- Customizable terrain resolution and noise settings
- Real-time texture painting on terrain
- Modular and clean C# scripts

## Scripts
- `TerrainGenerator.cs`: Handles noise-based heightmap creation
- `TerrainPainter.cs`: Allows texture painting with brush radius and strength

## Screenshots
_Add screenshots or gifs here if available_

## Requirements

- Universal Render Pipeline (URP) *(optional)*

## How to Use
